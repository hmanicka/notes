### Diligence on Feasibility & Value

#### 1. **Assessing Technical Feasibility in AI Projects**
   - Use external benchmarks such as research literature or competitor implementations to gauge feasibility.
   - Consider human-level performance (HLP) as a benchmark—if humans can perform a task given the same data, the AI model may also be capable.
   - Evaluate whether predictive features exist in structured data projects to determine if inputs (X) are strongly related to the desired output (Y).
   - Review the project's historical progress as an indicator of future improvement rates.

#### 2. **Using Human-Level Performance (HLP) for Benchmarking**
   - HLP is useful for assessing feasibility in unstructured data problems (e.g., images, speech).
   - Ensure that human evaluators only use the same data available to the AI system (e.g., an image from a camera, not direct visual inspection).
   - If humans struggle with a task using the provided data, the AI model will likely struggle as well.
   - Early identification of feasibility issues can save time—adjusting input data (e.g., camera setup) may be more effective than further model tuning.

#### 3. **Predictive Features and Project History in Feasibility Assessment**
   - Evaluate whether available input features (X) are predictive of the target output (Y) before committing to a project.
   - Example: Past purchase data can help predict future purchases, while social media chatter may not reliably predict long-term fashion trends.
   - Historical progress on a project can help estimate future improvement rates, often following an exponential decay pattern towards human-level performance.
   - A steady rate of error reduction relative to human performance can provide realistic expectations for project feasibility.
