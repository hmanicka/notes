### 3 Big Takeaways:

1. **Error Analysis is Key for Model Improvement**:
   - Error analysis helps identify patterns in misclassifications, guiding targeted improvements and ensuring efficient use of time by focusing on the most impactful errors.

2. **Prioritize High-Impact and Feasible Improvements**:
   - Focus on data categories where improvements will have the largest impact, considering both feasibility and user importance. Targeted data collection and focused efforts on critical categories lead to more efficient learning.

3. **In Skewed Datasets, Use Metrics Beyond Accuracy**:
   - In imbalanced datasets, raw accuracy can be misleading. Use tools like confusion matrices, precision, recall, and F1 scores to better evaluate model performance and focus on improving rare or important classes.
