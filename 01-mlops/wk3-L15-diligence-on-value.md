### Diligence on value

#### 1. **Bridging the Gap Between ML Metrics and Business Goals**
   - Machine learning teams focus on optimizing technical metrics (e.g., word-level accuracy), while businesses prioritize broader goals (e.g., user engagement and revenue).
   - A common challenge is aligning technical performance with business impact.
   - Achieving project success requires collaboration between ML engineers and business leaders to agree on meaningful, measurable metrics.

#### 2. **Estimating the Value of an ML Project**
   - Conducting rough estimations (e.g., "Fermi estimates") can help link ML improvements to business outcomes.
   - Small gains in model accuracy can have measurable impacts on key business metrics, such as user retention or revenue.
   - Finding a balance where both technical and business teams stretch outside their comfort zones is critical for project success.

#### 3. **Ethical Considerations in ML Projects**
   - Beyond economic feasibility, ML projects should be evaluated for their societal impact.
   - Ethical concerns such as fairness, bias, and net positive social value must be openly discussed within teams.
   - If a project does not contribute to societal well-being, it is worth reconsidering or abandoning it in favor of more meaningful initiatives.
