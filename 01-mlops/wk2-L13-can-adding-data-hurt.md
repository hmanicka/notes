### Key Takeaways

1. **Data Augmentation and Model Size**:
   - For unstructured data problems, adding accurately labeled data via data augmentation generally does not harm performance if the model is large and has sufficient capacity. Large models can effectively learn diverse data distributions without sacrificing accuracy.

2. **Rare Exceptions in Ambiguous Data**:
   - In rare cases where the mapping from input \( x \) to output \( y \) is ambiguous (e.g., distinguishing between visually similar characters like "1" and "I"), data augmentation may skew the data distribution and hurt performance. This typically occurs when ambiguous examples dominate the training set.

3. **Structured vs. Unstructured Data**:
   - The discussion primarily focuses on unstructured data, where data augmentation and large models shine. However, structured data problems require different techniques, which are addressed separately.
