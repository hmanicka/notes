### Improving Label Consistency


1. **Improving Label Consistency**
   - Review examples with multiple labelers or ask the same labeler to relabel after a break to assess consistency.
   - Facilitate discussions among labelers to define clearer labeling conventions and document these agreements.
   - Iterate by updating label instructions and re-evaluating data to improve consistency over time.

2. **Techniques for Handling Ambiguity in Labeling**
   - Standardize definitions of labels or merge similar classes to reduce inconsistencies (e.g., combining "deep scratch" and "shallow scratch" into one "scratch" class).
   - Introduce a new class for ambiguous cases, like "borderline" or "unintelligible," to improve clarity and reduce disagreements.

3. **Strategies for Small and Big Data Labeling**
   - For small datasets, rely on direct discussions between labelers to resolve inconsistencies.
   - For large datasets, use a small group to refine instructions before scaling labeling tasks.
   - Voting (consensus labeling) can be a fallback option, but itâ€™s often overused; focus on refining instructions first to minimize label noise.
