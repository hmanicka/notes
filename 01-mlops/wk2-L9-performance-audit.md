### Performance Auditing

1. **Pre-deployment Performance Audit**: Even when your algorithm performs well on accuracy or other metrics, it's crucial to conduct a final audit to identify potential issues. This audit helps catch problems like bias or errors on specific data subsets (e.g., gender, ethnicity, rare classes) before deployment.

2. **Brainstorm and Define Metrics**: Start by brainstorming potential failure points (e.g., poor performance on certain data slices or rare errors) and establish metrics to evaluate those areas. Tools like TensorFlow Model Analysis (TFMA) can assist in automatically evaluating performance on different data slices.

3. **Collaborative and Industry-Specific Standards**: Involve a team or external advisors to help brainstorm potential issues and ensure you're aware of current standards for fairness and bias in your industry. As AI fairness standards evolve, staying informed and proactive will reduce risks and improve system reliability.
