# Machine Learning Pipelines and Monitoring Systems

## What Are Machine Learning Pipelines?
- **Definition**: A pipeline involves multiple steps and components (both ML and non-ML) working together to produce a final outcome.
- **Example: Speech Recognition Pipeline**:
  1. **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)**:
     - Detects if someone is speaking.
     - Filters out silence to reduce bandwidth before sending data to the cloud.
  2. **Speech Recognition System**:
     - Converts audio to text.
  - **Impact**: Changes in VAD output can affect the performance of the speech recognition system.

## Monitoring Machine Learning Pipelines
- **Challenges**:
  - Changes in one component can cascade, affecting subsequent components.
  - Example: If VAD clips audio differently, it may degrade speech recognition accuracy.

- **Metrics to Monitor**:
  - **Software Metrics**:
    - Performance of individual components and the pipeline as a whole.
  - **Input Metrics**:
    - Detect changes in incoming data (e.g., audio quality, clickstream data).
  - **Output Metrics**:
    - Measure the quality of predictions or classifications at each stage.

- **Concept Drift and Data Drift**:
  - **Concept Drift**: Changes in the relationship between input data and output labels.
  - **Data Drift**: Changes in the distribution of input data.

## Example: User Profiles and Product Recommendations
- **Pipeline**:
  1. User clickstream data → User profile attributes (e.g., car ownership).
  2. User profiles → Recommendation system.
- **Problem**:
  - If clickstream data changes, predictions about user attributes (e.g., car ownership) may degrade.
  - This can reduce the accuracy of product recommendations.
- **Solution**:
  - Monitor metrics like the percentage of "unknown" labels in user profiles to detect issues.

## Data Change Rates
- **Factors Influencing Data Change**:
  - **User Data**: Typically changes slowly unless disrupted by significant events (e.g., COVID-19).
  - **Business Data**: Changes can be rapid due to operational decisions or new inputs (e.g., new materials in manufacturing).

## Best Practices for Monitoring
1. **Brainstorm Metrics**:
   - Include potential failure points in individual pipeline components.
2. **Design Alerts**:
   - Set thresholds for metrics to detect anomalies (e.g., increased silence in audio clips or more "unknown" labels in user profiles).
3. **Adapt Quickly**:
   - Update models or systems in response to detected changes.

## Next Steps
- **Practice Quizzes**: Reinforce understanding of pipeline monitoring and metrics.
- **Optional Programming Exercise**: Deploy an ML model on your computer to apply concepts.
- **Upcoming Topics**: A deeper dive into the modeling phase of the ML lifecycle.

**Summary**: Machine learning pipelines require careful monitoring at multiple stages to ensure robust performance despite data changes or component drift.
