### Milestones and Resourcing

1. **Defining Milestones and Resourcing**  
   - Clearly outline key project specifications, including ML metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.  
   - Consider software performance metrics such as latency, throughput, and queries per second.  
   - Estimate business impact, such as projected incremental revenue.  
   - Identify required resources, including data, personnel, cross-functional support, and software integrations.  
   - Establish a realistic timeline with defined milestones and deliverables.  

2. **Benchmarking and Proof of Concept (PoC)**  
   - If key specifications are unclear, conduct benchmarking against similar projects.  
   - Develop a PoC to test feasibility and gather insights on expected performance metrics.  
   - Use findings from PoC to refine milestone planning and resource allocation.  

3. **Finalizing the Scoping Process**  
   - Completing scoping ensures a well-structured, high-impact project.  
   - The framework of the full machine learning cycle—from scoping to deployment—supports successful project execution.  
   - A structured approach helps in selecting valuable and meaningful projects for deployment.
