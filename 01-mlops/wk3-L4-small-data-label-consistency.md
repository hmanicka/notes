### Small Data & Label Consistency

1. **Importance of Clean and Consistent Labels**  
   In small datasets, ensuring clean and **consistent labeling is critical for building effective models**. Consistency allows learning algorithms to confidently fit functions, even with limited data, as illustrated by examples in helicopter control, phone defect detection, and rare event labeling in larger datasets.

2. **Challenges of Small and Rare Data**  
   Small datasets and rare events within large datasets, such as edge cases in self-driving cars or long-tail products in recommender systems, present unique challenges. Labeling these instances consistently ensures higher model accuracy and better handling of critical, rare scenarios.

3. **Collaboration to Define Labeling Standards**  
   Achieving label consistency often involves collaboration among labelers to establish clear guidelines. For example, defining precise thresholds for defects (e.g., scratch size) can lead to more reliable labeling, improving algorithm performance even with limited or ambiguous data.
