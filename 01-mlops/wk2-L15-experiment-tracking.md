### Experiment Tracking

1. **Importance of Experiment Tracking**  
   Robust experiment tracking is crucial for managing numerous experiments, enabling you to systematically improve your algorithms and replicate results efficiently. Key elements to track include code version, dataset, hyperparameters, and results.

2. **Tracking Methods and Tools**  
   Begin with simple tools like text files or spreadsheets for small-scale tracking, but as the scope grows, consider adopting dedicated experiment tracking systems like Weights & Biases, Comet, MLflow, or SageMaker Studio for better scalability and functionality.

3. **Essential Features for Effective Tracking**  
   Effective tracking tools should support replicability by recording all critical details, provide insightful analysis and summary metrics for experiments, and offer features like resource monitoring, visualization, and error analysis to enhance understanding and decision-making.
