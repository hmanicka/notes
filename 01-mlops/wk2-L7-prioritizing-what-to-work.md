### Prioritizing what to work on

1. **Prioritize Data Categories Based on Improvement Potential**:
   When deciding which categories to focus on, consider both the gap to human-level performance and the percentage of data in each category. Larger improvements in more frequent categories (like clean speech) may yield better overall performance than improving less common categories (like car noise).

2. **Factor in Feasibility and Importance**:
   Prioritize categories where improvements are both feasible and important. For example, if you have ideas for improving accuracy in a specific category (e.g., car noise) and it’s critical for user experience (e.g., voice search while driving), it may be worth focusing efforts on that category.

3. **Targeted Data Collection for Efficiency**:
   Instead of broadly collecting more data, focus on adding or augmenting data in the most impactful categories. This targeted approach helps improve the learning algorithm’s performance more efficiently, avoiding wasted resources on less relevant data.
