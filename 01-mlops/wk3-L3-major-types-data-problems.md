### Major Types of Data Problems

1. **Machine Learning Problem Types Framework**  
   Machine learning problems can be categorized using a two-by-two grid based on data type (structured vs. unstructured) and dataset size (small vs. large). Best practices for data preparation and labeling differ significantly across these quadrants, with unstructured data often relying on techniques like **data augmentation** and structured data being **harder to augment or label**.

2. **Importance of Clean Labels**  
   For small datasets (e.g., under 10,000 examples), clean and consistent labeling is critical as mislabeled data can have a larger impact. Small datasets are manageable for manual inspection, whereas large datasets require robust labeling processes to ensure consistency at scale.

3. **Transferability of Insights Within Quadrants**  
   Advice and expertise are most applicable when they come from solving problems within the same quadrant of the grid. Machine learning strategies and instincts generalize better within similar problem types than across different quadrants, emphasizing the importance of understanding the specific characteristics of your problem.
