### Adding Features

1. **Feature Engineering in Structured Data**:
   - When dealing with structured data problems, generating new training examples can be challenging. Instead, improving performance often involves adding meaningful features (e.g., whether a person is vegetarian or if a restaurant has vegetarian options) based on insights from error analysis.

2. **Content-Based vs. Collaborative Filtering**:
   - Content-based filtering focuses on analyzing item descriptions (e.g., restaurant menus) to match users with recommendations, addressing the "cold start" problem. In contrast, collaborative filtering relies on user similarity and requires more historical data.

3. **Importance of Error Analysis and Feature Iteration**:
   - For structured data, error analysis helps identify improvement opportunities, such as missing features or user-specific patterns. Unlike unstructured data, where deep learning can automatically extract features, structured data still benefits significantly from manual or algorithm-driven feature design, especially with limited datasets.
