### Tips for getting started on modeling

1. **Start with a Practical Approach**:
   - Begin with a quick literature search to find reasonable algorithms and open-source implementations, rather than obsessing over the latest cutting-edge methods. A good algorithm with quality data often outperforms a complex one with poor data.

2. **Deployment Constraints Consideration**:
   - While deployment constraints like compute limitations are important, focus first on establishing a baseline for your project. If you're unsure whether the project is worth pursuing, donâ€™t worry too much about deployment constraints at this stage.

3. **Sanity Checks Before Full Training**:
   - Run quick sanity checks (e.g., overfitting a small dataset) before committing to training on large datasets. This helps identify bugs early and ensures your algorithm is working correctly on a small scale before scaling up.
