# Monitoring Machine Learning Systems

## Best Practices for Monitoring ML Systems

1. **Use Monitoring Dashboards**:
   - Dashboards track system performance over time.
   - Different dashboards may monitor specific metrics, e.g., server load, fraction of non-null outputs, or missing input values.

2. **Brainstorm Metrics with Your Team**:
   - Identify potential issues and metrics to detect them.
   - Example: Monitor server load to detect traffic spikes causing overload.

3. **Start Broad, Refine Later**:
   - Begin with a wide range of metrics.
   - Over time, remove less useful ones to focus on critical indicators.

## Types of Metrics to Monitor

### 1. **Software Metrics**:
   - Monitor system health (e.g., memory, compute latency, throughput, server load).
   - Often tracked by default in many monitoring tools.

### 2. **Statistical Metrics**:
   - **Input Metrics**:
     - Monitor changes in input data distribution (e.g., average audio length, image brightness).
     - Detect shifts that may affect model performance.
   - **Output Metrics**:
     - Assess model predictions and user behavior.
     - Examples:
       - Frequency of empty outputs in speech recognition.
       - User switching from voice input to typing (indicating frustration).

## Iterative Monitoring and Deployment

1. **Iterative Process**:
   - Like ML modeling, deployment involves multiple iterations.
   - Use real-world data and traffic to refine metrics and performance.

2. **Adapting Metrics Over Time**:
   - Introduce new metrics if unexpected issues arise.
   - Remove metrics that rarely change or add little value.

3. **Set Alarms with Thresholds**:
   - Define thresholds for critical metrics (e.g., server load > 0.91).
   - Trigger alerts to notify the team of potential problems.

## Maintenance and Retraining

1. **Model Maintenance**:
   - Regular updates may be needed for data or performance changes.
   - Retraining can be **manual** (common) or **automatic** (less frequent).

2. **Error Analysis and Updating**:
   - Monitor system metrics to spot performance issues.
   - Use error analysis and additional data to improve the model.

## Key Concepts Summary

- Monitoring is essential to detect and address performance issues.
- Metrics should be application-specific and evolve with real-world feedback.
- Maintenance and retraining are crucial for sustained performance.
- Complex systems with multiple models require advanced monitoring strategies (covered in future content).

**Remember**: Continuous monitoring and iteration help maintain robust and reliable ML systems.
