### Why is data definition hard

1. **Importance of Consistent Data Labeling**  
   Inconsistent labeling, as illustrated with the "iguana detection" and "phone defect detection" examples, can confuse machine learning algorithms and hinder model performance. Establishing a consistent labeling convention is crucial for effective training.

2. **Defining Data for Success**  
   A significant challenge in machine learning projects is determining the appropriate data inputs (X) and outputs (Y). Consistently labeled and well-defined data is the foundation for creating a quality dataset that enables successful modeling.

3. **Data Preparation as a Key Factor**  
   Properly preparing datasets is vital for the success of machine learning projects. While it's common to start with existing datasets, understanding best practices for data preparation, labeling, and baseline establishment can greatly enhance project outcomes.
