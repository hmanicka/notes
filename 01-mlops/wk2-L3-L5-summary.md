### 3 Big Takeaways:

1. **Focus Beyond Accuracy**:
   - High average accuracy isnâ€™t always enough. Performance on critical examples (e.g., rare classes, fairness considerations) and the application context must be prioritized to meet real-world requirements. Error analysis and fairness checks are essential for success.

2. **Establish Strong Baselines**:
   - For both structured and unstructured data, establishing a solid baseline (e.g., comparing to human-level performance or prior models) is crucial. It guides efficient improvements and helps manage expectations, especially when starting a project.

3. **Practical and Iterative Approach**:
   - Start with reasonable algorithms and open-source solutions, and focus on quick, manageable tasks like sanity checks to ensure the model is functioning correctly before scaling up. Avoid getting bogged down by deployment constraints early on.
