### What is scoping?

1. **The Importance of Selecting the Right AI Project**  
   - Choosing the right AI project is a rare and valuable skill.  
   - Jumping into a project without proper evaluation can lead to wasted effort.  
   - Evaluating multiple options before committing increases the chances of success.  

2. **Scoping a Project for Maximum Impact**  
   - Businesses can generate many project ideas (e.g., recommendation systems, search improvements, inventory management).  
   - Not all projects provide equal valueâ€”some are significantly more impactful.  
   - Scoping involves defining project goals, success metrics, and resource requirements.  

3. **Maximizing the Value of AI in Business**  
   - Machine learning can be applied in various ways, but prioritization is key.  
   - Selecting high-value projects (2x, 5x, or 10x more impactful) leads to greater business impact.  
   - A well-defined scoping process improves efficiency and ensures meaningful outcomes.
