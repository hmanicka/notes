### Scoping Process

#### 1. **Separating Problem Identification from Solution Identification**
   - Start by identifying **business problems**, not AI problems.
   - Work with business or product owners to understand key challenges.
   - Only after defining the problem should you brainstorm potential AI solutions.
   - Clear articulation of problems first leads to **better, more effective solutions**.

#### 2. **Evaluating Feasibility and Value of AI Solutions**
   - Assess the **technical feasibility** and potential **ROI (Return on Investment)** of AI-based solutions.
   - Perform due diligence to confirm whether an AI solution is truly **valuable and practical**.
   - If a solution is promising, outline **milestones** and budget resources accordingly.

#### 3. **Prioritizing Projects for Maximum Impact**
   - Avoid jumping into the **first exciting idea** without considering alternatives.
   - Use **divergent thinking** (brainstorm many options) followed by **convergent thinking** (narrow down to the best solutions).
   - Focus on projects that provide the **highest impact** in terms of monetary, social, or business value.
