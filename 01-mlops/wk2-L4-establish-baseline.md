### Key Takeaways for Establishing a Baseline in Machine Learning

1. **Human-Level Performance (HLP) as a Baseline for Unstructured Data**  
   - Establish a baseline by comparing your model's performance with human-level performance on tasks like speech recognition, images, or natural language processing. This gives you a reference point for what is possible and helps focus efforts on areas with the most room for improvement.

2. **Different Baseline Approaches for Unstructured vs. Structured Data**  
   - For unstructured data (e.g., images, audio, text), HLP is a useful baseline, whereas for structured data (e.g., databases, spreadsheets), HLP is less effective. In these cases, machine learning models often rely on literature searches or existing system performance as a starting point.

3. **The Importance of Baselines for Efficient Progress**  
   - A well-established baseline helps prioritize areas of improvement by showing potential performance limits and guiding efforts. It can also help manage expectations and avoid unrealistic accuracy targets, especially when a rough baseline is not yet defined.
