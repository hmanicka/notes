### More Label Ambiguity Examples

1. **Ambiguity in Data Labeling**  
   Label ambiguity, as seen in examples like speech recognition and user ID merging, can hinder the performance of machine learning algorithms. Consistent labeling instructions and standardization are critical to reducing noise and improving algorithm effectiveness.

2. **Importance of Data Quality**  
   Ensuring that input data (X) is of high quality is crucial for reliable labeling and learning. For instance, improving lighting in images or enhancing sensor quality can make data more interpretable and lead to better performance.

3. **Defining Data for Success**  
   Clearly defining both input features (X) and target labels (Y) is essential. Providing labelers with precise instructions and improving the consistency of labeling processes are key strategies for addressing ambiguity and ensuring the success of machine learning projects.
