### From Big to Good Data

1. **Shift from Big Data to Good Data**:
   - In many industries, having massive amounts of data is not always feasible. The focus should be on ensuring **good data** that is high-quality, relevant, and covers important cases, leading to better machine learning performance.

2. **Characteristics of Good Data**:
   - Good data provides **broad coverage of important cases** and includes diverse input examples. It is also **consistently labeled**, ensuring unambiguous definitions, and offers **timely feedback** through monitoring systems to detect data and concept drift.

3. **Importance Across ML Project Phases**:
   - Throughout the machine learning life cycle, from deployment to modeling, ensuring **data quality and coverage** is key. Future discussions will dive deeper into maintaining consistent definitions and scoping machine learning projects effectively.
