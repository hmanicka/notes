### What is Headless UI?

**Headless UI** is a type of UI library that provides functional components
**without** enforcing any specific design or styles. It allows developers to
implement custom UI while handling complex logic like accessibility, state
management, and interactions.

Think of it as **"pre-built logic, no opinionated styles."** It helps you avoid
reinventing the wheel but gives you the freedom to design your UI as you like.

### Why is it called "Headless"?

The term **"headless"** means that the library provides the **brains (logic)**
but not the **face (UI styles)**. You get **interactive, accessible components**
(like modals, dropdowns, or tabs) but must apply your own CSS or a styling
framework like Tailwind CSS.

### Example: Headless UI in Action

Letâ€™s say you need a **dropdown menu**. Normally, youâ€™d have to handle: âœ…
Keyboard navigation (Arrow keys)  
âœ… Focus trapping (So users donâ€™t lose focus)  
âœ… Accessibility (ARIA attributes)  
âœ… Click outside to close

With **Headless UI**, you can use their `<Menu>` component, which already
manages these behaviors, and just focus on designing it.

```tsx
import { Menu } from "@headlessui/react";

<Menu>
  <Menu.Button className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded">
    Open Menu
  </Menu.Button>
  <Menu.Items className="absolute bg-white shadow-lg rounded">
    <Menu.Item>
      {({ active }) => (
        <a
          className={`block px-4 py-2 ${active ? "bg-gray-200" : ""}`}
          href="/settings"
        >
          Settings
        </a>
      )}
    </Menu.Item>
  </Menu.Items>
</Menu>;
```

ðŸ”¹ The logic (opening/closing, keyboard support) is handled by **Headless
UI**.  
ðŸ”¹ The design (colors, spacing, layout) is **entirely up to you**.

### When Should You Use Headless UI?

- When you **want full control over styling**.
- When you **need accessibility and interactivity** without writing complex
  logic.
- When using **CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS** that encourage utility-first
  styling.
- When building **custom, brand-consistent UI** while keeping reusable logic.

### Key Takeaways

âœ” **No pre-built styles** â€“ Just the functionality  
âœ” **Improves accessibility** â€“ Handles ARIA and keyboard interactions  
âœ” **Works with any styling system** â€“ Tailwind, CSS, or styled-components  
âœ” **Useful for UI-heavy apps** â€“ Dashboards, forms, modals, etc.
