# Machine Learning Project Life Cycle

### **Key Takeaways**
1. **Machine Learning Life Cycle Overview**:
   - Provides a structured approach for planning and executing ML projects.
   - Helps identify all necessary steps, minimizing surprises.
   - Iterative by nature, allowing adjustments throughout the process.

2. **Major Steps in the ML Project Life Cycle**:
   - **Scoping**:
     - Define the project objectives.
     - Determine **X** (input) and **Y** (output) of the system.
     - Identify the application of ML.

   - **Data Collection and Preparation**:
     - Acquire and organize the required data.
     - Define a baseline and label data as needed.
     - Learn best practices for handling and managing data.

   - **Model Training**:
     - Select the appropriate model.
     - Train the model and conduct **error analysis**.
     - Adjust or collect more data as needed based on analysis.

   - **Final Checks**:
     - Conduct audits and final performance checks.
     - Ensure reliability for the intended application.

   - **Deployment**:
     - Write production-ready software.
     - Deploy the system and monitor live data performance.
     - Learn from real-world data and update the system.

   - **Post-Deployment Maintenance**:
     - Monitor system performance and track incoming data.
     - Handle changes in data distribution.
     - Retrain or update the model as necessary.

3. **Iterative Nature of Machine Learning**:
   - Deployment is only halfway to the finish line.
   - Lessons learned from live traffic refine the model and improve performance.
   - Maintenance often involves returning to earlier steps in the cycle.

4. **Broad Applicability**:
   - Framework applies to a wide range of projects (e.g., computer vision, speech recognition, structured data).
